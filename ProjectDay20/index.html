        <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class
            functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser
            environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a
            prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative,
            and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.</p>
        <p>JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function
            variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and Object utilities), and
            source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through toString()).

        <p>This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages
            or other host environments. For information about APIs that are specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs
            and DOM.</p>
        <p>The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript
            Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to
            document it. This means that cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been
            implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features. Most
            of the time, this happens between the stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially
            published.</p>

        <p>Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language — JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". Both
            "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries.
            However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use. Client-side
            JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
            (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and
            respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Server-side JavaScript extends
            the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
            extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one
            invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</p>
        <p>JavaScript first steps
            Answers some fundamental questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and "what can
            it do?", along with discussing key JavaScript features such as variables, strings, numbers, and arrays.</p>

            JavaScript building blocks
            Continues our coverage of JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to
            commonly-encountered types of code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events.
            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
            language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows
            most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why
            it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
            system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript
            has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based
            model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript
            also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
            objects, executing as loosely typed methods

        <p>Introducing JavaScript objects
            The object-oriented nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with your
            knowledge of the language and write more efficient code, therefore we've provided this module to help you.
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
            server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
            continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations
            on a server. The ECMAScript specification is a set of requirements for implementing ECMAScript. It is useful
            if you want to implement standards-compliant language features in your ECMAScript implementation or engine
            (such as SpiderMonkey in Firefox, or V8 in Chrome).

            The ECMAScript document is not intended to help script programmers. Use the JavaScript documentation for
            information when writing scripts.

            The ECMAScript specification uses terminology and syntax that may be unfamiliar to a JavaScript programmer.
            Although the description of the language may differ in ECMAScript, the language itself remains the same.
            JavaScript supports all functionality outlined in the ECMAScript specification.

            The JavaScript documentation describes aspects of the language that are appropriate for a JavaScript
            programmer.

            Asynchronous JavaScript
            Discusses asynchronous JavaScript, why it is important, and how it can be used to effectively handle
            potential blocking operations such as fetching resources from a server.

        <p>Client-side web APIs
            Explores what APIs are, and how to use some of the most common APIs you'll come across often in your
            development work.
            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g.,
            having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side
            versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than
            downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide
            programmatic control over them.

            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
            elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
            variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
    </div>
    <script src="./script.js"></script>
</body>
